2#I've heard you aren't from around here? I just moved back here and I am looking for work. Do you have anything?#There is something you could do. I am here to hunt, and in order to successfully hunt, you need a certain knowledge of the area. I wish to put up deer cams on some nearby trees, but I cannot stand that buffoon at the general store. If you want to help, you could pick them up for me from that delinquent.#y#3
3#I'll see what I can do.#I am much obliged.#y#0

4#Here are the deer cams you needed.#Excellent! I cannot thank you enough. That boy was trying my patience just getting some simple rations last time I went in. Let me know if you would like more to help with.#n#0

5#Is there more I can help with?#Why, yes there is. You know I am a hunter, but perhaps you do know why I am here.#n#6
6#Why?#My esteemed friend and colleague Mr. George Locke was hunting in these woods for a mysterious beast known as Bigfoot. He went missing some weeks ago, and no one has heard from him since.#y#7
7#That's terrible!#It is, and now I find myself here, without a clue to go on as to his fate. I know the last place he was believed to be hunting. If you could go there and bring me any evidence as to his whereabouts. I will mark the location on your map.#y#8
8#Ok, I will be back with information.#Please make all haste.#y#0

9#I found this journal. I think it belonged to your friend.#I was hoping that it wouldn't come to this. I always told George one of his dangerous hunts would get the best of him, and now I am afraid that time has come. Thank you for this news, however unfortunate it may be.#n#10

11#Would you like help with anything?#I think enough time has already been wasted! After reading George's journal, I believe this Bigfoot creature is real! I believe the beast is dangerous as well! We need to find it, and put it down!#n#12
12#How do you plan to do that?#Here, take this spare rifle. I believe from George's notes that Bigfoot is a creature of habit, and if you can learn his patterns, we can find him and kill him. We can divide and conquer; I will search my portions of the forest, and you search yours. I will kill the beast the moment I see it, and I would encourage you to do the same.#y#13
13#Ok, I will look for him.#For the hunt! For George!#y#0
