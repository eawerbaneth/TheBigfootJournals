2#Can you tell me anything about Bigfoot?#Hrmp, are you another one of those crazy Bigfoot hunters? This town has a lot more to offer besides that nonsense.#y#3
3#You don't believe in him?#Ha, do you believe in the Tooth Fairy and the Easter Bunny, too? Listen, I'm going all the way to Capitol Hill, and no smear ad is going to associate me with crap like that.#y#4 0
4#All the way to Capitol Hill? You want to be in Congress?#Hell yeah! I'm not gonna go for it until I'm 35, you know, for my reputation, so until then I'm stuck in this dirt-farm of a town.#y#5
5#If you don't like this town why don't you try to work in Olympia or Seattle?#Hell, I'd rather be the mayor of Terd Mountain than some secretary until I can make my play.#y#0
6#I think Dr. Salt is going to try to murder Mr. Mansfield!#What? What makes you think that?#n#7

8#What can you tell me about Ms. Redford?#Oh, her family has lived here for generations. Without the sane tourist that her Bed and Breakfast draws in, I think we would be completely overrun by the Bigfoot crazies.#y#0

9#What can you tell me about Dr. Salt?#Dr. Salt has had his veternary practice here for over thirty years. He doesn't talk to me much, but I think it hit him hard when the last mayor died so unexpectedly.#y#0

10#What do you know about Richard Mansfield?#He only came to town a week or two ago. He seems nice enough, and Ash Mountain relies on the hunter tourism for our income, so treat him well while he's here.#n#0

11#Do you know Robbie?#Hmph, yeah, I think there is something wrong with that kid. He's always starig at me with his mouth hanging open like some kind of moron. Maybe you can be a good influence for him.#n#0

12#Have you ever heard of a man named Otis?#They say he's some fanatic that lives somewhere up in the mountains. As long as he doesn't scare away tourists, I guess he isn't doing any harm.#n#0
