I have examined these tracks and I can confirm they are not bear tracks, and are far to big to be a mans. They must be sasquatch prints. I am sure she is here in these hills, I will find her. I am getting less and less sleep though, strange noises wake me in the night. The do not sound like her though, more like another mans. - RC 9/25
